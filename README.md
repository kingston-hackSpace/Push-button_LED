### HARDWARE

- ARDUINO UNO
- Push-button
- LED
- Resistor 220 ohms
- Resistor 10K ohms

Note: Remember that LEDs have a positive and negative lead. You may burn the LED if wired incorrectly. See [here](https://github.com/kingston-hackSpace/Button_LED/blob/main/Understanding_LEDs.png)

### PROGRAMMING THE PUSH-BUTTON

**EXAMPLE 1: SIMPLE BUTTON STATE**

- See wiring-diagram [here](https://github.com/kingston-hackSpace/Button_LED/blob/main/Diagram.png)

- Upload [this code](https://github.com/kingston-hackSpace/Button_LED/blob/main/Button_LED.ino) to your Arduino Board

- Check your result:
    
    - Does the LED turn on/off when you press/release the button?
    
    - Does it turn off when you release it?
    
    - Open the Serial Monitor — do you see “pressed” and “not pressed” updating?

- How it works:

    - In this code, we are using the variable *buttonState* to check if our Arduino is receiving a HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V) signal from the button.
 
    - if *buttonState == LOW*, then turn-on the LED.
 
- This *buttonState* logic works for simple interactions such as this one, in which the LED is following exactly the behaviour of the button.

- However, it is not suitable for counters, or more complex escenarios such as event-based actions. In the next example, you will explore *edge-detection*, where a button-press becomes a single, clean event rather than a continuous signal.
      
**EXAMPLE 2: EDGE DETECTION**

- Use the same wiring as before.

- Upload [this code] to your Arduino board.

- Here, we are no longer interested in “Is the button pressed?”. Instead, we ask “Did something just happen?”

- In the previous example (STEP 1), the button presses would interfere with timing logic in our code. Instead, the logic used in this new example (STEP 2) is essential for multitasking, without stopping anything else in our code. In other words, our code won't be executing any isntructions while there is no change in buttonState. 

**EXAMPLE 3: DEBOUNCING**

- The Arduino loops very fast and sometimes things in the physical world like buttons may not be fast enough. To eliminate errors and false readings from buttons and other switches, a “debounce” routine can be used. We will create a "debounce timer" to avoid this problem.
